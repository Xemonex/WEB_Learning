      <h2>Timeline of his life:</h2>
      <article>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="date">1822</span> - Gregor Mendel was born in German-speaking family in Hynčice, Austrian empire, now Czech republic.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1840</span> - He started to study practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at Philosophical institute of the Palacký University Olomouc. But financial struggle forced him to to become monk.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1850</span> - With a dose of irony Mendel failed his oral and the last exam in Biology to become teacher.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1851</span> - He was send by his abbot to study physics at University of Vienna well known  Christian Doppler.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1856</span> - He again failed his oral exam to become certified teacher. After return to his abbey Gregor Mendel started to experiment with pea plants and observed different traits to be inherited in dominant, hybrid and recessive form when pea was crossed. His experiments with over 30 000 pea plants led him to make generalizations, now known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1866</span> - Mendel's paper about his work was published, but was nearly ignored by scientific comunnity.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1867</span> - After death of hiss abbot, he was elected as a new abbot, which limited his subsequent research due to lack of time.
          <li><span class="date">1869</span> - Elected as vice president of Natural Science association if Brno, his only lifetime recognition. But in the same year he worked on his second essay about crossing Hieracium, which is now well known for very atypical reproduciton, so he deduced that his previous work was probably wrong.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1884</span> - Gregor Mendel died, withouth recognition of his work in his lifetime.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1900</span> - Three scientist independently of each other rediscovered Mendel's work. Genetics as a science field was born.</li>
